Count Special Multivariate
**************************

This Sage-module computes generating functions for the number of some
special multivariate polynomials over finite fields.

Module
======

multi-def.sage
    run within Sage to obtain symbolic expressions (q) for the number
    of reducible/s-powerful/absolutely irreducible polynomials at
    degree n in r variables over GF(q).
